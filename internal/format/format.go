// Package format holds the project's single rendering contract for values
// that reach an operator — currently byte counts.
//
// It exists because the same number was being rendered three different ways:
// notifications divided by 1024 twice and printed "%.1f MB" (so a 2 TB backup
// read as "2097152.0 MB"), while internal/engine and internal/anomaly each
// carried their own copy of an adaptive formatter. Anything that shows a size
// to a user should call Bytes, so the number a person sees is the same
// wherever they see it.

// Bytes renders a byte count as an adaptive, human-friendly string
// (B / KB / MB / GB / TB / PB), matching the web UI's formatBytes helper:
// 1024-based units, one decimal place, with a trailing ".0" trimmed — so
// 34359738368 → "32 GB", 1572864 → "1.5 MB", 1536 → "1.5 KB".
//
// The unit is chosen by dividing until the value drops below 1024, so a count
// just under a boundary renders in the smaller unit rather than as "1024 KB".
