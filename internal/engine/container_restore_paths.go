// The restore file picker presents a container's contents as container-internal

// the volume mounted at `/config` (see dedupManifestToTarIndex and the classic
// volume index merge in the jobs handler). Extraction, however, happens one
// volume at a time against paths relative to that volume's root. These helpers
// are the translation between the two, so classic and chunked restore agree on
// what a selection means (issue #275).

// ContainerVolumePath renders a volume-relative path the way the picker shows
// it: joined onto the volume's container-internal mount destination. The API's
// restore-point browsing uses it so the listing and the extraction filter below
// cannot drift into different spellings of the same file.

// It returns the volume-relative paths to extract and whether the volume is
// wanted at all. Three outcomes:
//
//   - (nil, true) — restore the whole volume. Either the selection is empty
//     (no picker filter: restore everything, the pre-#275 behaviour) or the
//     user picked the mount point itself.
//   - (paths, true) — restore only these paths within the volume.
//   - (nil, false) — the selection names nothing in this volume, so it must be
//     skipped entirely. Extracting it anyway is the bug in issue #275.
//
// Selecting a directory selects its contents: the returned paths are fed to
// the same tarIncludeSet / manifest filter the folder handler uses, which
// already treats a picked directory as covering its descendants.
