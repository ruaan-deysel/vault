# Contributing to Vault

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vault. This project welcomes contributions from human developers and autonomous AI coding agents alike.

Go backup and replication daemon with Svelte web UI for Unraid servers.

To maintain code quality, protect maintainer capacity, and prevent maintainer burnout, all contributors must follow the standardized development and governance workflow outlined below.

---

## Code of Conduct and Standards

- Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative.
- Zero secrets policy: Never commit passwords, tokens, API keys, private certificates, or personal data.
- Anti-burnout principle: Perform full due diligence locally before opening pull requests or requesting review.

---

## Development Workflow

All contributions—whether submitted by humans or AI agents—must adhere to this step-by-step workflow:

### 1. Open a GitHub Issue First
- Every bug fix, feature, or enhancement must start with an issue.
- Use the appropriate GitHub Issue Form:
  - Bug Report (`01-bug-report.yml`)
  - Enhancement Request (`02-enhancement-request.yml`)
- Blank or unstructured issues are disabled. Pull requests without a corresponding issue will be closed.

### 2. CodeRabbit AI Plan Generation
- Once the issue is created, CodeRabbit AI is triggered to generate an implementation plan (either automatically via the `bug` or `enhancement` label, or by commenting `@coderabbitai plan` on the issue).
- CodeRabbit analyzes the codebase and posts a comprehensive Coding Plan containing:
  - Codebase research and affected components
  - Architectural design choices
  - Phased task breakdowns
  - Machine-readable agent prompts and verifiable acceptance criteria
- Contributors must review, refine, and confirm the plan before writing code. Do not start implementation without an approved plan.

### 3. Create a Dedicated Branch
- Create a feature or bugfix branch off `main`:
  - Features: `git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
  - Fixes: `git checkout -b fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
  - Documentation: `git checkout -b docs/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
- Never commit directly to the default branch (`main`).

### 4. Implementation and Local Validation
- Implement changes following project conventions and the approved plan.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` describing what changed and why.
- Run all required local validation checks (tests with coverage, linters, type checkers, and formatters). Ensure all checks pass with zero errors and zero warnings.

### 5. Follow the Pull Request Template
- Open a Pull Request using `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Complete all sections in the template:
  - Summary of changes
  - Linked issue keywords (`Fixes #<issue>`, `Closes #<issue>`, `Addresses #<issue>`)
  - Verification steps and pasted terminal output
  - Mandatory Pre-Submission Governance checklist (every box must be checked)

### 6. Open PR as DRAFT First
- Pull requests MUST be opened in Draft mode (`gh pr create --draft` or choose "Create draft pull request" in GitHub).
- Draft PRs allow CI workflows to run in isolation without triggering premature reviewer notifications or consuming unnecessary review capacity.
- Verify that all CI checks pass in draft mode and confirm that everything is working as expected from your end.

### 7. Mark Ready for Review
- Only after all local and draft CI checks have succeeded, convert the pull request to "Ready for Review".
- Pull requests marked ready for review with failing checks, incomplete templates, or unverified changes will be converted back to draft or closed.

### 8. Automated Quality Gates and Merge Criteria
Before a pull request can be merged, it must satisfy all automated quality gates:
- CodeRabbit AI Review: All review comments and suggestions must be resolved or addressed.
- GitHub Copilot Code Review: Must pass with no blocking feedback.
- Codecov Coverage Reports: Must pass with zero errors, zero warnings, and no coverage regressions below the repository target.
- Branch Ruleset Checks: All required status checks defined in the default branch ruleset must pass.

## Local Development and Verification

### Prerequisites and Setup

- Go 1.24 or later
- Node.js (v20+) and npm (for Svelte UI in `web/`)
- Pre-commit (`make pre-commit-install`)

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Go dependencies and local build
make deps
make build-local

# Run Go unit and integration tests
make test

# Run Go linter and security audit
make lint
make security-check

# Build and test web frontend
cd web && npm ci && npm run build && npm run lint && npm test && cd ..

# Run all pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit-run
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow Conventional Commits:

- `feat(<scope>): <description>` — New feature
- `fix(<scope>): <description>` — Bug fix
- `docs(<scope>): <description>` — Documentation changes
- `test(<scope>): <description>` — Adding or updating tests
- `refactor(<scope>): <description>` — Code restructuring without functional change
- `chore(<scope>): <description>` — Tooling, dependencies, or repository maintenance

---

## Pull Request Governance Summary

- No spam or back-to-back PRs: Batch related changes into a single PR.
- AI-assisted PRs require human verification and local testing before submission.
- All template checkboxes must be confirmed.
- PRs must remain in Draft until verified.
